	TEXT CHARACTER=15 TEXT='When the mouth is anterior and terminal, mouth orientation is fixed as it can only face anteriorly. However, if the mouth is in a ventral position, then it can face anteriorly (Kerygmachela interpretation of Park et al., 2018), ventrally (anomalocaridids) or posteriorly (crown euarthropods, opabiniids). This character is only applicable when mouth is ventral.  ^n^nAdapted from:^n[SC: 7; Y: 23]^n^nMost lobopodian taxa possess a terminal anterior mouth – for example Aysheaia (Whittington 1978), Onychodictyon ferox (Ou et al. 2012) and Kerygmachela (Budd 1993, 1998a) – as do Eutardigrada (e.g. Halberg et al. 2009; Persson et al. 2012).  The mouth is also terminal in many lobopodians, including Collinsium, hallucigeniids and Luolishania, even if it is turned ventrally due to flexure of the neck (Ma et al. 2009; Smith and Caron 2015; Yang et al. 2015).  We score this transformation series as uncertain in Megadictyon as it is difficult to determine whether the mouth was originally ventral (cf. Liu et al. 2007) or whether this appearance results from compaction. The mouth opening is ventrally oriented in Pambdelurion (Budd 1998b), radiodontans (Daley et al. 2009; Daley and Edgecombe 2014), Onychophora and Heterotardigrada (Eriksson and Budd 2000; Ou et al. 2012; de Sena Oliveira and Mayer 2013; Mayer et al. 2013b; Persson et al. 2014); it faces posteriad in Opabinia (Whittington 1975; Budd 1996; Budd and Daley 2012) and upper stem-group euarthropods (Edgecombe and Ramsköld 1999; Haug et al. 2012b; Yang et al. 2013; Ortega-Hernández 2016).

The transformation series is coded as absent where the oral region is clearly displayed externally, as in Tardigrada, euarthropods from Kerygmachela crownwards (where the position of the mouth is marked by the expression of an ‘oral cone’), Jianshanopodia (Vannier et al. 2014), Aysheaia (Whittington 1978), and Siberion (Dzik 2011).  It is coded as ambiguous in other taxa, as the location of the original mouth is unclear.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=17 TEXT='[SC: 9; Y: 25]^nThe mouth of many ecdysozoans is surrounded by radially-arranged cuticular or sclerotized structures.  In priapulids and other cycloneuralians these are typically conical spines, arranged centripetally when the pharynx is contracted and centrifugally when the pharynx is everted (Conway Morris 1977).  In basal panarthropods such as Aysheaia, Kerygmachela, Hallucigenia and Jianshanopodia, the structures are regular non-sclerotized lamellae, aciculae or plates (Whittington 1978; Budd 1998a; Vannier et al. 2014; Smith and Caron 2015); among anomalocaridids the plates are sclerotized and differentiated (Daley and Bergström 2012; Daley et al. 2013a, b).  (Although the three or four prominent plates in the anomalocaridid oral cone are differentiated to give rise to bilateral symmetry (Daley and Bergström 2012), the underlying radial arrangement of these plates is clear: some plates straddle the midline, and if rotated by 90° the smaller plates are equivalent to their counterparts.)  Tardigrades bear circumoral lamellae (Budd 2001a; Guidetti et al. 2012; Mayer et al. 2013b).  Antennacanthopodia is coded as ambiguous as there is no direct evidence for the location of the mouth.  Opabinia is coded as ambiguous; radial structures around the mouth are drawn by Whittington (1975) but not interpreted, and further study is needed to confirm their status.  The cuticular ring reported in the head of Microdictyon (Liu and Dunlop 2014) requires detailed study before its interpretation can be considered secure. Other lobopodians are coded as ambiguous; euarthropods and onychophorans are coded as absent (discussed in Smith and Caron 2015, trans. ser. 9).';

Taxa whose mouth region is unknown or is known from a limited sample size are coded ambiguous to reflect the possibility that eversion was possible but not displayed in the available material.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=26 TEXT='[SC: 13]^nIn many taxa the pharynx is lined with cuticular sclerites or "pharyngeal teeth".  Priapulids have an eversible pharynx lined with pharyngeal teeth (van der Land 1970; Conway Morris 1977).  Hallucigenia sparsa has a structurally differentiated (narrower) pharynx lined with acicular teeth (Smith and Caron 2015).  Jianshanopodia bears a series of pharyngeal teeth with multiple cusps (Liu et al. 2006; Vannier et al. 2014).  This fossil, perhaps alongside Omnidens (Hou et al. 2006), resembles a longitudinally extended Hurdia mouthpart; the inner rows of teeth in Hurdia are correspondingly interpreted as pharyngeal teeth (Daley et al. 2009, 2013a).  Sclerotized teeth have also been reported in the foregut of Paucipodia (Hou et al. 2004), although the nature and distribution of the teeth is not clear from the fossil material. Onychophorans bear a differentiated pharynx with an oesophageal constriction, but this is unornamented (Elzinga 1998).  Most tardigrade taxa exhibit two to five  rows of buccopharyngeal teeth (= mucrones) caudally to their circumoral lamellae (Pilato 1972; Schuster et al. 1980; Dastych et al. 2003; Guidetti et al. 2012); a further row of sclerotized transverse ridges (=baffles) may also correspond to pharyngeal teeth.  Coded as ambiguous in all other taxa due to inadequate preservation.';

Hallucigenia sparsa has acicular teeth that come to a single point (Smith and Caron 2015).  The teeth of Hurdia and Jianshanopodia have multiple cusps (Daley et al. 2009, 2013a; Vannier et al. 2014); tardigrade teeth do not (Pilato 1972; Schuster et al. 1980; Dastych et al. 2003).';

In Tardigrades (e.g. Hansen & Katholm 2002), Hurdia (Daley et al., 2009) and Cambroraster (Moysiuk & Caron 2019) the pharyngeal teeth are directly adjacent to the radially arranged circumoral structures.';

In Tardigrades, the presence of stylet glands, responsible for the moulting and production of stylet and stylet supports are likely transformed claw glands (Morbjerg et al., 2018).

Although Liu et al.

	TEXT CHARACTER=37 TEXT='[SC: 20]^nIn most panarthropods, the first pair of limbs is pre-ocular (at least developmentally), is associated with the protocerebral segment, and is structurally differentiated from other limb pairs.  In hallucigeniids, however, the first limb pair is not structurally differentiated from its neighbour; moreover, the great distance between the head and the first limb pair in Hallucigenia sparsa (Smith and Caron 2015) argues against a pre-ocular or indeed cerebral identity of these appendages.  Whether or not the first appendage pair truly corresponds to the pre-ocular appendage of other groups, the absence of a differentiated pre-ocular appendage characterizes a number of armoured lobopodians: Xenusion (Dzik and Krumbiegel 1989), Diania (Ma et al. 2014), Microdictyon (Chen et al. 1995b), Paucipodia (Chen et al. 1995a; Hou et al. 2004), H. fortis (Ramsköld and Chen 1998), and H. sparsa (Smith and Caron 2015).

	TEXT CHARACTER=65 TEXT='[SC: 24; Y: 14]^nThere are various taxa in which the deutocerebral appendage pair is morphologically differentiated from the rest of the trunk appendages (see references in Liu and Dunlop 2014). For example, Antennacanthopodia has a second set of antenna-like limbs that are morphologically distinct from the walking legs (Ou et al. 2011). Daley and Edgecombe (2014) recently redescribed Anomalocaris canadensis and reported the presence of a smaller set of flaps in proximity with the putative head region; given that this differentiation is expressed in size, rather than structural identity, we score the deutocerebral limbs as undifferentiated in Anomalocaris. The nature of the second appendage in Schinderhannes is unclear due to poor preservation (Kühl et al. 2009). The first pair of legs in Tardigrada is serially homologous with the deutocerebral segment of Euarthropoda (Mayer et al. 2013b), and thus is not structurally different from the rest of the trunk appendages. The deutocerebral jaws of Onychophora are significantly modified relative to the rest of the appendages in the body (Eriksson et al. 2010; de Sena Oliveira and Mayer 2013).  In Euarthropoda, this morphological differentiation is generally expressed in the presence of an antenniform (e.g. Edgecombe and Ramsköld 1999; Ma et al. 2012a; Yang et al. 2013) or raptorial (Chen et al. 2004; Haug et al. 2012b; Tanaka et al. 2013) deutocerebral appendage.  The second leg pair of hallucishaniid taxa are not differentiated from their neighbours (Ramsköld and Chen 1998) and are therefore coded as undifferentiated; the trunk limbs are instead divided into two morphological zones (trans. ser. 66).  The second appendage pair of Cardiodictyon does not seem to be differentiated (Liu et al. 2008a).
